## Project Description

- used [Yew](https://yew.rs/) for frontend.
- used Axum, a backend framework by team behind [tokio](https://tokio.rs)

## Learnings

- Frontend Rust sucks
- Yew documentation sucked; they had a major change version change recently but didn't update their docs, massive L
- Backend Rust is amazing
- Making your own auth is hard (skill issue ðŸ¥²)
- Writing `.clone` everywhere is emotionally painful, so you try to fight the borrow-checker
- But you know you lost the battle, when the answer you found is just wrapping the thing in a good 'ol `Rc<RefCell<T>>`
